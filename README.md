- [] Navigate to top/bottom of list with Fn+arrow.
- [] Arrow navigation should scroll the pane.

    - [x] F3 - view file (opens in associated app), also works with double click or ENTER.
    - [] F4 - edit file (opens in text editor).
    - [] F5 - copy a file/folder or selection to the other pane.
    - [] F6 - move a file/folder or selection to the other pane.
    - [] F7 - create new folder in the active pane.

    - [x] Name
    - [x] Size
    - [x] Modified date
- [] When a directory opened in a pane is deleted while the app is closed, reset the location to the parent directory if it exists (keep going up the hierarchy), else the Home directory.
- [] When a directory opened in a pane is deleted while the app is closed, reset the location to the parent directory if it exists (keep going up the hierarchy), else the Home directory.

**Nice to have**

- [] Disk drive selection for computers with multiple drives.
- [] Progress indicators for various operations (copy, move, etc).
- [] File type icons.
- [] Pane tabs.
    - [] New tab with CMD/CTRL+T.

- [] Bookmarks - mark files & folders as favorite and find them in a list.

[](#issues)

**Issues**

- [] üêõ Production builds are failing across all platforms.
- [] üêõ Navigating higher than "/" should be disallowed.
- [] üêõ Focusing the app from a cold start allows tabbing only after clicking inside the pane once.
- [] üêõ Navigating to a folder should clear any file selections in that pane.
- [] üêõ Sorting a column header in a tab should make that tab active.
- [] üêõ F-keys in the command bar are not clickable.
- [] Windows:
    - [] üêõ It starts in an empty nameless folder with only the parent ".." folder. Navigating to it goes to "C:\Users\<my-user>". From there I can't navigate to the parent folder due to permissions, but I can navigate to folders within.
    - [] üêõ The breadcrumbs are wrong; the URL splitting is done naively for Mac only.
    - [] üêõ The file open action doesn't work.

## Download

Download the binary for your platform under [Releases](https://github.com/breadthe/Paneful/releases).

**Note** Binaries don't work as of v0.3.0.

## Building the app

In addition to the above, if you want to build the binaries yourself, first install the [Tauri environment + CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) (including the Rust CLI + Cargo), then clone this repo and run:

```shell
npm install

# dev mode
cargo tauri dev

# build the production app
cargo tauri build
```

## Contributing

This project is purely experimental and I can't guarantee it will hold my interest long term, but if you wish to contribute please focus on these areas:

* [Issues](#issues) are the highest priority.
* [Beyond MVP](beyond-mvp) features are next.

I am not interested in ideas beyond what's listed under [Features]([](#feature-list)).
